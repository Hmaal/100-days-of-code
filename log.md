# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: November 1st, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Got back up to speed (after not working on it for weeks) and made updates to capturing the Channel Id and sending that information to the database.

**Thoughts:** For whatever reason, I pushed off starting....eventually, though, when I sat down it all felt natural and time slowly disappeared. 

I'm going to try to expand on my toolset in the coming days (as an example, committing my project to github through the terminal vs. the UI) and will one day explain some about the project but trying to start things on a good footing.

Somethings to come:
- Clean up this repo (appreciate the template @kallaway)
- Learn a little markdown in the process
- Expand my experience with git and Github
- Update high-level project description

**Today's Progress**: Didn't make much progress, hit a roadblock for testing the Twitch API in an Extension Front End which I'll have to work around for now. I should be able to test via Twitch itself versus just entirely via local, but will probably sideline this specific item and come back to it later when I feel ready to spend enough time to figure it out.

**Thoughts:** I feel anxious knowing that I have to sit down and do 1 hour, but also excited about the potential progress and amount of work that needs to be done. I feel like my setup and tools need a lot of attention to make this a comfortable and truly enjoyable experience but I currently do not have the time to make large changes, so will slowly adjust until everything is right.
