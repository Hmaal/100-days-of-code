# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: November 1st, 2021
#####

**Today's Progress**: Got back up to speed (after not working on it for weeks) and made updates to capturing the Channel Id and sending that information to the database.

**Thoughts:** For whatever reason, I pushed off starting....eventually, though, when I sat down it all felt natural and time slowly disappeared. 

I'm going to try to expand on my toolset in the coming days (as an example, committing my project to github through the terminal vs. the UI) and will one day explain some about the project but trying to start things on a good footing.

Somethings to come:
- Clean up this repo (appreciate the template @kallaway)
- Learn a little markdown in the process
- Expand my experience with git and Github
- Update high-level project description
