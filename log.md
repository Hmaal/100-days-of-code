# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: November 1st, 2021
#####

**Today's Progress**: Got back up to speed (after not working on it for weeks) and made updates to capturing the Channel Id and sending that information to the database.

**Thoughts:** For whatever reason, I pushed off starting....eventually, though, when I sat down it all felt natural and time slowly disappeared. 

I'm going to try to expand on my toolset in the coming days (as an example, committing my project to github through the terminal vs. the UI) and will one day explain some about the project but trying to start things on a good footing.

Somethings to come:
- Clean up this repo (appreciate the template @kallaway)
- Learn a little markdown in the process
- Expand my experience with git and Github
- Update high-level project description

### Day 1: November 2nd, 2021
#####

**Today's Progress**: Didn't make much progress, hit a roadblock for testing the Twitch API in an Extension Front End which I'll have to work around for now. I should be able to test via Twitch itself versus just entirely via local, but will probably sideline this specific item and come back to it later when I feel ready to spend enough time to figure it out.

**Thoughts:** I feel anxious knowing that I have to sit down and do 1 hour, but also excited about the potential progress and amount of work that needs to be done. I feel like my setup and tools need a lot of attention to make this a comfortable and truly enjoyable experience but I currently do not have the time to make large changes, so will slowly adjust until everything is right.

### Day 2: November 3rd, 2021
#####

**Today's Progress**: Ignoring the roadblocks from yesterday, as the source issue continues to pile up today, I was able to make pretty decent progress on a path forward. Stubbed out the request to get data from the database and the handler for that on the backend. Confirmed and tested that they are both working properly, so the next step is to actually build the query to the database and return the results.

**Thoughts:** Another day of gently wanting to put it off. Today was really busy overall so I started much later today than normal. This is a great viewport into what things will be like on hectic days. I'm tired from the day but it felt good to sit down and focus. Time actually flew by as I was coding, but I still feel like I'm spending too much time on other things like documentation, writing notes, planning code, etc... I think its a good use of time thought and I'm sure its part of the process but just a feeling. 

(Sidenote: I feel like I should have started count at 1 instead of 0. May change in the future. XD)

**Today's Progress**: Spent most of today getting my project environment setup on a different computer. Once I got everything resolved, had to figure out where I left off and was able to clean up the GET request a little. More progress to make.

**Thoughts:** I don't even know where to begin. Its been a long past 3 days. Due to some life events was unable to make any progress, though I was some level determined. When I was able to make some progress, I didn't know where to begin considering that I'm on a different computer and the idea of pullin my code down onto this computer would require me to reset up my environment form scratch. This thought put me off for a day and I knew I had to make progress some how, so I bit the bullet and spent hours getting things back into working order.

Obviously, I've skipped a few days and will have to make those up, with interest, so I'll think on that, but I'm thinking an extra day of work (2 days / day skipped). I have time, since I'm still early on, but I have plenty of other goals that I've got to reach, so will work on those. Forgive me all for the skipped days.
